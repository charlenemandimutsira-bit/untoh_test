## Curatorial Statement

  Our curatorial process began with a discussion of all our collection’s oral histories to identify common themes and Library of Congress subject headings. For our themes, we identified the Great Depression and changes in technology. We also observed that many of the oral histories featured Floyd Jenkins as the interviewer, so we opted to include only the interviews he conducted to provide an additional throughline. While these interviews mainly reflect the positionality of white men in the early twentieth century, they provide an understanding of the lives of community leaders in the small towns throughout North and Central Texas.

  We chose CollectionBuilder for our contextualization because of our familiarity with the platform and its capabilities that met the needs of our contextualization. We used CollectionBuilder to create simple visualizations to supplement our oral histories and exhibit statement. These visualizations can help a user browse through the collection and find the items they need, making it user-friendly. Additionally, CollectionBuilder has different themes that you can use to customize your webpage to your specific needs and audience. We also wanted to include elements, including photos and quotes from the resources, and CollectionBuilder allows you to embed images easily.

  As working women and graduate students in the 21st century, it is hard to imagine what life was like for individuals in the early 20th century in Texas. In some ways, there was much more economic opportunity back then. People could start businesses and build their own homes without needing much capital at all, if they were white men, at least. The so-called American dream of building something from the ground up was somewhat feasible, which feels like pure fantasy today. On the other hand, we live much safer, healthier lives due to new technologies and medical advances. These oral histories offer insight into a way of life different than our own, due to factors such as time period, gender, and income status.
