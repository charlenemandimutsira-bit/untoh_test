## The Great Depression

<b>The Great Depression</b>

  In 1929, the world experienced a global economic collapse known as the Great Depression, which began in the United States. Throughout the 1930s, the economic hardships of the Great Depression affected everyone from hourly workers, to farmers, to the business owners featured in this collection. While some interviewees saw the loss of farms and possessions in their communities, others did not feel the effects of the Depression as much because they were children. Many businesses simply tried to stay afloat during the 1930s as real estate values fell and families’ spending money disappeared. Business owners kept their stores open through the sale of goods on credit and bartered with buyers for what they could afford, with some not collecting debt until 1942. These oral histories offer a first-person perspective on life in small Texas towns during the Great Depression.

<b>Changes in Technology</b>

  The rapid technological advancements of the post–World War II era, particularly around the 1950s, transformed how many small North Texas businesses operated. These interviews highlight how local business owners in North and Central Texas adapted to technological changes from the late 19th century through the 1970s. Entrepreneurs introduced automatic gasoline nozzles, modernized bakery equipment to boost efficiency, and adopted new dairy and refrigeration systems. The business owners describe how these innovations improved their work while they continued to rely on family labor and traditional practices. Altogether, these reflections reveal the relationship between technology and small business, offering insight into how communities met economic challenges while embracing innovations.
