## Exhibit Statement


## Themes

Our curatorial process began with a discussion about all of our collection’s oral histories to locate common themes and Library of Congress subject headings. For our themes, we identified the Great Depression and changes in technology as common threads. These topics came up repeatedly, and are relevant to the time period discussed in all of the oral histories. Though the interviews take place in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the majority of the content focuses on the first half of the 20th Century. We also observed that many of oral histories featured Floyd Jenkins as the interviewer, so we opted to include only interviews he conducted to provide an additional throughline to the oral histories. While these interviews mainly reflect the positionality of white men in the early twentieth century, they provide understanding on the lives of community leaders in the small towns surrounding the Dallas area of Texas.
We chose CollectionBuilder for our contextualization because of our familiarity with the platform and its capabilities that met the needs of our contextualization. CollectionBuilder can create several types of visualizations including subject term cloud visualizations and location cloud visualizations. These visualizations can help a user browse through the collection and find the items they need, making it user-friendly. Additionally, CollectionBuilder has different themes that you can use to customize your webpage to your specific needs and audience. We also wanted to include elements including photos and quotes from the resources, and CollectionBuilder allows you to embed images easily. 
As working women and graduate students in the 21st century, it is hard to imagine what life was like for individuals in the early 20th century in Texas. In some ways, there was much more economic opportunity back then. People could more easily start businesses and build their own homes without needing much capital at all, if they were white men at least. The so-called American dream of building something from the ground up was somewhat feasible, which feels like pure fantasy today. On the other hand, we live much safer, healthier lives due to new technologies and medical advances. These oral histories offer insight into a way of  life other than our own, due to factors such as time period, gender, and income status.  


The Great Depression

In 1929, the world experienced a global economic collapse known as the Great Depression, which began in the United States. Throughout the 1930s, the economic hardships of the Great Depression affected everyone from hourly workers to farmers, to the business owners in this exhibition. While some interviewees saw the loss of farms and possessions in their communities, others did not feel the effects of the Depression as much because they were children. Many businesses simply tried to stay afloat during the 1930s as real estate values fell and families’ spending money disappeared. Business owners kept their stores open through the sale of goods on credit and bartered with buyers for what they could afford, with some not collecting debt until 1942. These oral histories offer a first-person perspective on life in small Texas towns around the Dallas area during the Great Depression. 


Changes in Technology

The rapid technological advancements of the post–World War II era, particularly around the 1950s, transformed how many small North Texas businesses operated. These interviews highlight how local business owners in the Dallas area adapted to technological changes from before the 1930s through the 1970s. Entrepreneurs introduced automatic gasoline nozzles, modernized bakery equipment to boost efficiency, and adopted new dairy and refrigeration systems. Owners describe how these innovations improved their work while they continued to rely on family labor and traditional practices. Altogether, these reflections reveal the relationship between technology and small business, offering insight into how communities met economic challenges while embracing innovations.
