## Exhibit Statement

  This digital collection features oral histories collected by Dr. Floyd Jenkins, a business professor, as a part of the Business Archives Project at North Texas State University, now called the University of North Texas. These oral history interviews document the everyday operations, labor practices, customer relations, and lives of small Texas business owners from the 1890s to the 1970s. These business owners’ firsthand accounts offer valuable insight into these businesses adapted to economic shifts and technological change. 
  
  The collection serves as a relevant primary source for studying regional history, labor practices, entrepreneurship, and technological innovation of small businesses. From the stories of bakery owners Anne and Don Davis to those of auto mechanic and entrepreneur Ned Estes, we can gain perspectives on what historians and archivists called the quotidian, or the everyday. The scholar Liz Stanley refers to the quotidian as “the everyday and seemingly mundane and commonplace - is at one and the same time both ordinary and extraordinary. and has both ‘small’ and ‘big’ story attributes.” These stories aren’t talking about famous figures in history, but rather normal, working people living through historical events. 
  
  This oral history collection fills an important gap in digital archives by centering the lived experiences of family-owned business owners in small towns in Texas rather than centering big business operations in metropolitan centers. While these stories are certainly overlooked, a glaring omission from these histories is the stories and contributions of workers, women, and people of color, which contributes to the narrative that these white, male business owners are the “representative” leaders of their communities. 

Additionally, our small but mighty collection aims to elevate the forgotten stories and voices of Texas business owners. This collection differs from other business-centered digital libraries like EBSCO’s Business Source Ultimate digital library or the American Economic Association’s EconLit digital library in that it provides more context to how these individuals lived, felt, and triumphed over their hardships. In other words, the business research articles of Business Source Ultimate (2025) and the economics research articles of EconLit (2025) provide materials that aim to share original research work with other scientists to reproduce or refute, as stated in Nature Education (2014), but they don’t really provide the distinctive, personal perspectives that our collection provides. 

Now, creating a collection like this–one that portrays people, not scientific variables—as well as reuses data from another database (i.e. The Portal to Texas History) comes with its own challenges, as we’ve discussed in class. Boté & Térmens (2019) paper, “Reusing Data: Technical and Ethical Challenges” identifies several ethical challenges when reusing research data, including but not limited to informed consent, data trustworthiness, and recognizing authorship/data licensing. Thankfully, the Portal to Texas History, where we acquired all of our exhibitional items from, is known for its commitment to running an ethical digital library, as seen by the hundreds of content partners that work with them to provide access to their plethora of materials (About, n.d).
