## Exhibit Statement

  This digital collection features oral histories collected by Dr. Floyd Jenkins, a business professor, as a part of the Business Archives Project at North Texas State University, now called the University of North Texas. These oral history interviews document the everyday operations, labor practices, customer relations, and lives of small Texas business owners from the 1890s to the 1970s. These business owners’ firsthand accounts offer valuable insight into how these businesses adapted to economic shifts and technological change. 

  The collection is a relevant primary source for studying the regional history, labor practices, entrepreneurship, and technological innovation of small businesses. From the stories of bakery owners Anne and Don Davis to those of auto mechanic and entrepreneur Ned Estes, we gain perspectives on what historians and archivists called the quotidian, or the everyday. The scholar Liz Stanley refers to the quotidian as “the everyday and seemingly mundane and commonplace - is at one and the same time both ordinary and extraordinary. and has both ‘small’ and ‘big’ story attributes.” These stories aren’t talking about famous figures in history, but rather normal, working people living through historical events. 

  This oral history collection fills an important gap in digital archives by centering the lived experiences of family-owned business owners in small towns in Texas rather than focusing on big business operations in metropolitan centers. While these stories are certainly overlooked, a glaring omission from these histories are the stories and contributions of workers, women, and people of color, which contributes to the narrative that these white, male business owners are the representative leaders of their communities.

## Curatorial Statement and Themes

  Our curatorial process began with a discussion about all of our collection’s oral histories to locate common themes and Library of Congress subject headings. For our themes, we identified the Great Depression and changes in technology as common threads. These topics came up repeatedly, and are relevant to the time period discussed in all of the oral histories. Though the interviews take place in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the majority of the content focuses on the first half of the 20th Century. We also observed that many of oral histories featured Floyd Jenkins as the interviewer, so we opted to include only interviews he conducted to provide an additional throughline to the oral histories. While these interviews mainly reflect the positionality of white men in the early twentieth century, they provide understanding on the lives of community leaders in the small towns throughout North and Central Texas.

  We chose CollectionBuilder for our contextualization because of our familiarity with the platform and its capabilities that met the needs of our contextualization. We used CollectionBuilder to create simple visualizations to supplement our oral histories and exhibit statement. These visualizations can help a user browse through the collection and find the items they need, making it user-friendly. Additionally, CollectionBuilder has different themes that you can use to customize your webpage to your specific needs and audience. We also wanted to include elements including photos and quotes from the resources, and CollectionBuilder allows you to embed images easily. 

  As working women and graduate students in the 21st century, it is hard to imagine what life was like for individuals in the early 20th century in Texas. In some ways, there was much more economic opportunity back then. People could start businesses and build their own homes without needing much capital at all, if they were white men at least. The so-called American dream of building something from the ground up was somewhat feasible, which feels like pure fantasy today. On the other hand, we live much safer, healthier lives due to new technologies and medical advances. These oral histories offer insight into a way of life different than our own, due to factors such as time period, gender, and income status.  


<b>The Great Depression</b>

  In 1929, the world experienced a global economic collapse known as the Great Depression, which began in the United States. Throughout the 1930s, the economic hardships of the Great Depression affected everyone from hourly workers, to farmers, to the business owners featured in this collection. While some interviewees saw the loss of farms and possessions in their communities, others did not feel the effects of the Depression as much because they were children. Many businesses simply tried to stay afloat during the 1930s as real estate values fell and families’ spending money disappeared. Business owners kept their stores open through the sale of goods on credit and bartered with buyers for what they could afford, with some not collecting debt until 1942. These oral histories offer a first-person perspective on life in small Texas towns during the Great Depression. 


<b>Changes in Technology</b>

  The rapid technological advancements of the post–World War II era, particularly around the 1950s, transformed how many small North Texas businesses operated. These interviews highlight how local business owners in North and Central Texas adapted to technological changes from the late 19th century through the 1970s. Entrepreneurs introduced automatic gasoline nozzles, modernized bakery equipment to boost efficiency, and adopted new dairy and refrigeration systems. Owners describe how these innovations improved their work while they continued to rely on family labor and traditional practices. Altogether, these reflections reveal the relationship between technology and small business, offering insight into how communities met economic challenges while embracing innovations.
